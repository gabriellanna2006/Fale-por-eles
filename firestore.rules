/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for 'Fale Pelos Animais' application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes data availability while maintaining basic security.
 * Public read access is granted where appropriate, while write access is restricted to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /incident_reports/{incidentReportId}: Stores incident reports.
 * - /animal_welfare_resources/{animalWelfareResourceId}: Stores animal welfare resources.
 * - /educational_articles/{educationalArticleId}: Stores educational articles.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Incident reports have open reads and writes are only permitted.
 * - Animal welfare resources and educational articles are completely public (read-only).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Incident reports denormalize reporter information (reporterName, reporterContact) directly into the document to avoid needing to `get()` user data during authorization.
