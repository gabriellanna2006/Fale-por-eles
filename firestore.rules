/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for 'Fale Pelos Animais' application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes data availability while maintaining basic security.
 * Public read access is granted where appropriate, while write access is restricted to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /incident_reports/{incidentReportId}: Stores incident reports.
 * - /animal_welfare_resources/{animalWelfareResourceId}: Stores animal welfare resources.
 * - /educational_articles/{educationalArticleId}: Stores educational articles.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Incident reports can be created by anyone (including anonymous users) to encourage reporting.
 * - To prevent spam and abuse, reads, updates, and deletes on incident reports are disallowed for now.
 *   This can be changed later to allow administrators to view reports.
 * - Animal welfare resources and educational articles are completely public (read-only).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Incident reports denormalize reporter information (reporterName, reporterContact) directly into the document.
